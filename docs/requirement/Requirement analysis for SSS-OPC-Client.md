Overview
This document outlines the feature set for a licensable OPC client designed for industrial automation, incorporating both standard and innovative features to meet customer demands and leverage emerging technologies.

Architectural Foundation
Description: Defines the core architectural principles for the OPC client system.
Details: The system will be built upon a hybrid architecture. This includes a core OPC client library/service developed using .NET 6+ for cross-platform compatibility (Windows, Linux, macOS). For advanced functionalities, a separate server-side application (e.g., built with ASP.NET Core using RESTful APIs or gRPC for inter-service communication [Essential for defining how different parts of the system and external clients interact with the backend]) will support centralized management, backend AI processing, automated reporting services, and will serve a web-based User Interface. Communication between the core library/service and the server-side application will utilize efficient and secure protocols like gRPC or message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) depending on the interaction pattern (e.g., synchronous request/response vs. asynchronous eventing) [Essential for defining the internal system architecture and ensuring efficient, secure communication between components]. Data serialization formats such as Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) for gRPC and JSON for RESTful APIs will be utilized. Data models for inter-service communication, including message schemas for queues and contract definitions for APIs, will be clearly defined. This modular design ensures scalability and maintainability.
*   **Implementation Approach**: Deployment will follow a phased approach, potentially starting with core client functionalities followed by server-side components and advanced features. A pilot program with selected customer sites may be utilized to validate the architecture in a real-world environment before broader rollout.
*   **Data Migration Strategy**: For customers transitioning from existing OPC client solutions, a strategy for migrating client configurations (e.g., server connection details, initial tag sets) to the new system's configuration database will be provided. This includes defining data mapping, transformation logic if needed, and validation procedures.
*   **Legacy System Integration**: During the transition period, the system must coexist with legacy OPC client instances if a phased rollout is adopted, ensuring no disruption to critical operations. Clear plans for the eventual decommissioning of replaced legacy systems will be established.
*   **Business Rule**: Adherence to the organization's existing enterprise architecture standards and IT governance policies for new system deployments must be ensured.

Allows users to browse server namespaces, read current tag values, and write updates. Ensures low-latency communication for time-critical applications, with target read/write latency of less than 50ms (P99) for typical operations. Error handling for failed read/write operations (e.g., communication timeouts, connection loss, invalid tag address) will be implemented, providing clear status codes and messages to the calling application or UI. Data validation rules for write operations (e.g., range checks, type checks if configurable by user) will be supported.
*   **Data Migration Strategy**: A mechanism for importing existing tag configurations (e.g., tag lists, addresses, scaling parameters) from common legacy OPC client formats or spreadsheets will be provided to expedite setup. Validation of imported configurations will be performed.
*   **Cutover Plan**: For critical systems, parallel run testing (where feasible) of the new client alongside the legacy client for a defined period might be employed before full cutover to validate data accuracy and performance. Success criteria will include matching data values and response times.
*   **Business Rule**: All write operations to critical control system tags must be logged with user credentials, timestamp, old value, and new value for audit trail purposes, in compliance with relevant industry regulations (e.g., FDA 21 CFR Part 11 for pharmaceutical applications).

Historical Data Access
Description: Retrieves historical data for analysis and reporting.
Details: Implements the OPC Historical Access specification, supporting queries over specific time ranges. Includes data aggregation, filtering, and trend visualization tools. Supported data aggregation functions will include, but are not limited to, average, minimum, maximum, count, range, total, and various interpolation types (e.g., linear, stepped). Historical data and alarm/event logs will be stored in a suitable time-series database (e.g., InfluxDB, TimescaleDB) for efficient querying and long-term storage. The data model for historical data storage will specify fields such as timestamp, tag identifier, value, quality, and any relevant metadata. Data ingestion into the time-series database will be handled via optimized batching mechanisms or streaming connectors [Important for ensuring efficient and reliable data flow from OPC sources to storage], with configurable data validation rules (e.g., timestamp sanity checks, value range checks) prior to ingestion. Query response times for a 1-day range of 100 tags should be less than 2 seconds, utilizing native query languages like Flux for InfluxDB or SQL for TimescaleDB [Needed for development and integration]. Error handling for HDA queries (e.g., data not found for the specified range, query timeout, invalid aggregation parameters) will provide informative feedback.
*   **Data Migration Strategy**: For customers with existing historical data in other systems (e.g., proprietary historians, SQL databases), a comprehensive data migration plan will be developed. This includes defining procedures for data extraction, transformation (e.g., timestamp normalization, tag name mapping, unit conversion), loading into the new time-series database, and rigorous validation of migrated data against source data (e.g., record counts, spot checks, aggregate comparisons). Tools and scripts to support this migration will be considered.
*   **Training Requirements**: Engineers and analysts will require training on HDA query tools, aggregation functions, and trend visualization features.
*   **Business Rule**: Historical data queries for regulatory reporting must use validated data sources and aggregation methods as defined by applicable industry standards or compliance mandates.

Supports role-based access control (RBAC), potentially integrated with an Identity Provider (IdP) using OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect (e.g., Keycloak, Azure AD, Okta) for managing user identities and access to the web UI and APIs [Critical for robust user authentication and authorization]. Key management procedures will be established for managing cryptographic keys, including generation, storage, rotation, and revocation, adhering to industry best practices. If an internal user management system is utilized alongside or instead of an IdP, it will enforce configurable password policies (e.g., complexity, length, history, expiration). Additionally, the system will incorporate secure credential management (e.g., using hardware security modules where appropriate, or managed identity services like Azure Managed Identities or AWS IAM Roles for cloud resources), ensure AI model integrity and implement access controls for AI models, and provide end-to-end encryption for communications with the centralized management interface. Secure API authentication methods (e.g., JWT, API Keys) will be used for server-side application endpoints [Essential for protecting backend services]. Regular security audits will be mandated. Comprehensive audit logging will capture security-relevant events, including login attempts (successful and failed), authorization changes, administrative actions, and access to sensitive data. Data will be classified (e.g., Confidential, Restricted, Internal, Public), and protection mechanisms will be applied accordingly. Compliance with relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, or industry-specific standards, as applicable to target markets) will be addressed. User configurations and other specifically designated sensitive data will be stored using a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, SQL Server) with appropriate security measures including encryption at rest. Other categories of data that may be sensitive, such as alarm/event logs or historical process values, will be stored in their respective specialized databases (e.g., time-series databases for historical data and alarm/event logs) with security measures equivalent to those applied to the relational database, ensuring consistent and robust security across all data stores handling sensitive information. Where applicable for non-production environments or specific use cases, data masking or anonymization techniques will be available for sensitive data.
