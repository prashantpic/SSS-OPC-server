# Repository Specification

# 1. Name
data.migrations


---

# 2. Description
A dedicated repository for managing the relational database schema lifecycle. It contains all database migration scripts, managed by Entity Framework Core Migrations. This approach allows for version-controlled, incremental, and automated updates to the PostgreSQL database schema. Each migration represents a specific change to the database model, ensuring that the schema can be reliably evolved alongside the application code and deployed consistently across all environments (development, testing, production). This repository is a critical dependency for the CI/CD pipeline, which will execute these migrations during the deployment process of any service that relies on the relational database.
