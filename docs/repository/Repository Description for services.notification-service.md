# Repository Specification

# 1. Name
services.notification-service


---

# 2. Description
A dedicated microservice for handling all outgoing system notifications. It consumes events from a message queue, such as critical alarm escalations or system health alerts, and dispatches them through the appropriate channels. It supports multiple notification mechanisms, including email (via SMTP) and SMS (via third-party gateways). This service isolates the logic and credentials for third-party communication services, providing a single, reliable point for all system-to-human alerts. It maintains notification templates and can be configured with user preferences for notification delivery.
