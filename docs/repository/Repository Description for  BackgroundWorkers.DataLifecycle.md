# Repository Specification

# 1. Name
BackgroundWorkers.DataLifecycle


---

# 2. Description
A background worker service responsible for enforcing data lifecycle policies. It periodically runs jobs to handle data retention, which includes archiving old data from primary databases (e.g., time-series) to cheaper, long-term blob storage, and securely purging data that has exceeded its configured retention period. It logs all its actions for auditability.
