# Repository Specification

# 1. Name
ui.blazor-web-app


---

# 2. Description
This is the master UI repository for the entire system, containing the Blazor WebAssembly Single Page Application (SPA). It is responsible for providing a cohesive and integrated user experience by coordinating all frontend functionalities. This repository houses the primary application shell and integrates various functional modules, whether they are built as separate components within this repo or potentially as micro-frontends. It orchestrates the user interface for centralized management, data visualization dashboards, alarm and event monitoring consoles, report configuration, AI model interaction, and user/role administration. It communicates exclusively with the backend via the 'gateways.api-gateway' repository, ensuring a clean separation of concerns. It is responsible for implementing WCAG accessibility standards, localization, and a responsive design.
