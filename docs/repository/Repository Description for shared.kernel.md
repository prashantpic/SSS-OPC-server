# Repository Specification

# 1. Name
shared.kernel


---

# 2. Description
This is the Shared Kernel repository, acting as a domain aggregator and shared resource library for the entire distributed system. It is a foundational repository that does not contain executable code but provides common building blocks to ensure consistency and reduce code duplication across all microservices. Its primary role is to coordinate the domain language and technical contracts between services. It contains: shared Data Transfer Objects (DTOs), Protocol Buffers (.proto) contract definitions for gRPC, common enumeration types, custom exception classes, and reusable utility functions or extension methods. All other service repositories depend on this kernel for a unified and consistent set of shared artifacts.
