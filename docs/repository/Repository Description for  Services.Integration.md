# Repository Specification

# 1. Name
Services.Integration


---

# 2. Description
This microservice acts as a hub for integrating with external ecosystems. It contains the logic to connect to cloud IoT platforms (Azure IoT, AWS IoT), stream data to Augmented Reality (AR) devices, log critical transactions to a private blockchain, and enable bi-directional data flow with Digital Twin platforms. It handles the specific protocols (e.g., MQTT, WebSockets), data mapping, and security requirements for each external system.
