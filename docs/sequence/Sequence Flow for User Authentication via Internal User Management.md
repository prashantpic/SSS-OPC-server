# Specification

# 1. Sequence Design Overview

- **Sequence_Diagram:**
  ### . User Authentication via Internal User Management
  Illustrates the process of a user logging into the web interface using credentials stored and managed internally by the system. The sequence covers credential submission, validation against the database, JWT generation, and session establishment.

  #### .4. Purpose
  To detail the standard login process when an external Identity Provider is not in use, focusing on the interaction between the UI, API Gateway, and the Authentication Service.

  #### .5. Type
  AuthenticationFlow

  #### .6. Participant Repository Ids
  
  - REPO-APP-PRESENTATION
  - REPO-APP-AUTH
  - REPO-APP-DATA
  
  #### .7. Key Interactions
  
  - User submits username and password via the Blazor UI (Presentation Layer).
  - Presentation Layer sends credentials to the Authentication Service API endpoint.
  - Authentication Service hashes the submitted password and queries the Data Service (User table) for the matching user.
  - Data Service returns the stored user record with the password hash.
  - Authentication Service validates the password, generates a JWT for the user with appropriate claims (roles, permissions).
  - JWT is returned to the Presentation Layer, which stores it for subsequent API calls.
  - User is granted access to the web application.
  
  #### .8. Related Feature Ids

  - REQ-3-010
  - REQ-UIX-001
  
  #### .9. Domain

  #### .10. Metadata
  
  - **Complexity:** Medium
  - **Priority:** Critical
