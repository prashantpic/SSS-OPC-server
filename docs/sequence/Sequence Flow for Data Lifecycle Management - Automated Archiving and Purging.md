# 1. Sequence Design Overview

- **Sequence_Diagram:**
  ### . Data Lifecycle Management - Automated Archiving and Purging
  This sequence illustrates the automated background process for managing the data lifecycle. A scheduled job checks data retention policies, archives old historical data to cold storage, and purges data that has exceeded its retention period.

  #### .4. Purpose
  To detail the process for complying with data retention policies, managing storage costs, and meeting regulatory requirements.

  #### .5. Type
  BusinessProcess

  #### .6. Participant Repository Ids
  
  - REPO-APP-DATA
  - ColdStorage
  
  #### .7. Key Interactions
  
  - A scheduled job within the Data Service is triggered (e.g., daily).
  - The job reads the DataRetentionPolicy configurations from the relational database.
  - For a 'HistoricalData' policy, it identifies data partitions/records in the time-series database older than the retention period but within the archive period.
  - The Data Service queries and streams this old data from the time-series database.
  - The data is written to a configured cold storage location (e.g., Azure Blob Archive Storage).
  - Upon successful archival, the job executes a delete/purge command on the time-series database for the archived records.
  - The job logs its actions (e.g., 'Archived 1M records to Azure Blob', 'Purged data older than 365 days') to the audit log.
