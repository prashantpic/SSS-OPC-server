# Specification

# 1. Sequence Design Overview

- **Sequence_Diagram:**
  ### . OPC Server Redundancy Failover
  Shows the Core OPC Client's automated response to a primary OPC server failure. It details the failure detection, the switch to a pre-configured backup server, and the re-establishment of subscriptions to ensure high availability.

  #### .4. Purpose
  To document a critical reliability feature, ensuring minimal data loss and operational disruption in high-availability environments.

  #### .5. Type
  FeatureFlow

  #### .6. Participant Repository Ids
  
  - REPO-APP-CLIENT
  - PrimaryOpcServer
  - BackupOpcServer
  
  #### .7. Key Interactions
  
  - Core OPC Client is communicating normally with the Primary OPC Server.
  - The Primary OPC Server becomes unavailable (crash, network loss).
  - The Core OPC Client's health check/heartbeat mechanism fails to get a response from the Primary OPC Server after configured retries.
  - The client triggers its failover logic.
  - It connects to the pre-configured Backup OPC Server endpoint.
  - Upon successful connection, the client re-establishes all active subscriptions with the Backup OPC Server.
  - The client resumes data collection from the Backup OPC Server, meeting RTO/RPO targets.
  - A failover event is logged and an alert is sent to administrators.
