# Specification

# 1. Sequence Design Overview

- **Sequence_Diagram:**
  ### . Natural Language Query for Historical Data
  A user types or speaks a plain-text query, like 'What was the average temperature in Tank 1 yesterday?'. The query is processed by an NLP engine, translated into a structured database query, executed, and the result is returned to the user.

  #### .4. Purpose
  To detail the interaction with an NLP service, a key innovative feature designed to simplify data access for non-technical users.

  #### .5. Type
  IntegrationFlow

  #### .6. Participant Repository Ids
  
  - REPO-APP-PRESENTATION
  - REPO-APP-AI
  - REPO-APP-DATA
  - NlpService
  
  #### .7. Key Interactions
  
  - User enters a natural language query into the Blazor UI (Presentation Layer).
  - Presentation Layer sends the text query to the AI Service.
  - AI Service sends the query text to an external or internal NLP Service (e.g., Azure Cognitive Service).
  - NLP Service performs intent recognition ('get historical average') and entity extraction ('temperature', 'Tank 1', 'yesterday').
  - NLP Service returns the structured intent and entities to the AI Service.
  - AI Service translates the structured information into a formal query for the Data Service, looking up the tag ID for 'Tank 1 temperature'.
  - Data Service queries the time-series database.
  - The result is returned through the chain to the Presentation Layer, which displays the answer to the user.
