# 1. Sequence Design Overview

- **Sequence_Diagram:**
  ### . Scheduled Automated Report Generation and Distribution
  Illustrates the automated, backend process of generating a scheduled report. A scheduler triggers the Reporting Service, which gathers data, generates the report file (e.g., PDF), and distributes it via email.

  #### .4. Purpose
  To show the workflow of the automated reporting feature, a key requirement for management and compliance.

  #### .5. Type
  BusinessProcess

  #### .6. Participant Repository Ids
  
  - REPO-APP-REPORTING
  - REPO-APP-DATA
  - REPO-APP-AI
  - REPO-APP-NOTIFICATION
  
  #### .7. Key Interactions
  
  - A scheduled job (e.g., Hangfire, Cron) triggers the Reporting Service to generate a specific report.
  - Reporting Service retrieves the report template and data requirements from the Data Service (relational DB).
  - Reporting Service queries the Data Service for necessary historical data (from time-series DB).
  - Optionally, Reporting Service queries the AI Service for insights (e.g., top anomalies for the period).
  - Reporting Service uses a library (e.g., QuestPDF) to generate the report file (PDF, Excel).
  - Reporting Service requests the Notification Service to email the generated report to the configured distribution list.
  - Notification Service sends the email with the report as an attachment.
