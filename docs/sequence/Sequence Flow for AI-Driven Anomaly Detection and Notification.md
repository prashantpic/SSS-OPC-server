# 1. Sequence Design Overview

- **Sequence_Diagram:**
  ### . AI-Driven Anomaly Detection and Notification
  Shows the flow for real-time anomaly detection. Data is streamed to the AI Service, which uses a model to detect unusual patterns. If an anomaly is found, it's logged, and an event is published for notification.

  #### .4. Purpose
  To illustrate the proactive monitoring capabilities of the innovative AI features, showing how raw data is turned into actionable insight.

  #### .5. Type
  FeatureFlow

  #### .6. Participant Repository Ids
  
  - REPO-APP-CLIENT
  - REPO-APP-MESSAGING
  - REPO-APP-AI
  - REPO-APP-DATA
  - REPO-APP-NOTIFICATION
  
  #### .7. Key Interactions
  
  - Core OPC Client streams real-time data to the Message Queue.
  - The AI Service is a consumer of this data stream.
  - AI Service preprocesses the incoming data and feeds it into a deployed anomaly detection model (e.g., ONNX).
  - The model flags a data point or sequence as anomalous.
  - AI Service logs the detected anomaly details (timestamp, tag, value, context) to the time-series database via the Data Service.
  - AI Service publishes an 'AnomalyDetected' event to the Message Queue.
  - The Notification Service consumes this event and sends an alert (e.g., email, SMS) to configured users.
