# 1. Sequence Design Overview

- **Sequence_Diagram:**
  ### . CI/CD Pipeline for a Microservice Update
  Details the automated process from a developer committing code for a microservice (e.g., Reporting Service) to its deployment in a production environment. It involves the interaction between Git, the CI/CD server, container registry, and Kubernetes.

  #### .4. Purpose
  To visualize the DevOps process, which is essential for ensuring regular, reliable, and secure software updates as per requirements.

  #### .5. Type
  Administrative

  #### .6. Participant Repository Ids
  
  - REPO-SAP-015
  - REPO-APP-REPORTING
  - ops.iac-kubernetes
  - ContainerRegistry
  - KubernetesCluster
  
  #### .7. Key Interactions
  
  - Developer pushes code changes for the Reporting Service to its Git repository (REPO-APP-REPORTING).
  - The push triggers a CI/CD pipeline defined in ops.cicd-pipelines.
  - The pipeline agent checks out the code, builds the .NET project, and runs unit/integration tests.
  - Upon successful tests, the pipeline builds a new Docker image for the service using the Dockerfile from ops.iac-kubernetes.
  - The Docker image is tagged and pushed to a Container Registry.
  - The CD part of the pipeline (potentially after a manual approval step) updates the Kubernetes deployment manifest (from ops.iac-kubernetes), changing the image tag.
  - The pipeline applies the updated manifest to the Kubernetes Cluster.
  - Kubernetes performs a rolling update, terminating old pods and starting new ones with the updated image.
